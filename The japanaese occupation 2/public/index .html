    Only 3 more days to celebrate the Lunar New Year. This is the year of the horse. In normal circumstances, people should be in a jubilant mood and preparing for the New Year
     celebration. But in reality that is not the case. The people are very scared and sad. This is because Singapore, the well-fortified fortress, has fallen to the Japanese. Thus
      we the locals are under the Japanese occupation now. Immediately after the occupation, the Japanese started controlling the food supplies. Because of this essential products such
       as rice, vegetables, and other goods are strictly rationed, which is not sufficient for most families. De Liang is one of my loyal workers, he worked for me for a very long time.
        He comes from a destitute family. Recently De Liang faced difficulties in feeding his family, especially the kids with the basic food. Like others, he had to solely rely on rationed
         food, which was not enough to feed his family. Thus the situation forced him to loot for food. Unfortunately, he was caught by the Japanese and later beheaded and the head was
          displayed at the Singapore River for the public to see. How cruel are these Japanese? I have been boycotting Japanese Goods in my stores for the past few months. I have secretly
           donated to the China Relief Fund to support the Chinese resistance against Japan. But nowadays I am scared because the Japanese started carrying out Operation ‘Sook Ching’ to remove
            all the anti-Japanese elements from the locals. The local men had to assemble at mass screening centers such as the YMCA (Young Men Christian Association) in Stamford Road. I went
             to the screening yesterday. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to survive the screening thus I got the stamped paper, which means I was safe for some time. What a scary experience
              being screened!

      The situation in Singapore under Japanese occupation is getting worse every day. More and more Sook Ching operations are conducted, the suspects are brought in batches to
       the Punggol & Changi beaches and executed mercilessly. This made the ordinary people suspect each other. They do not know who the informants are. Yesterday only I received
        credible information from a trustworthy source. A fellow Hokkien businessman, a good friend of mine named ‘Lim Bo Seng’ was involved in bombing the causeway route to impede
         the Japanese movement into Singapore. This has slowed down the Japanese from entering the country. Luckily Lim Bo Seng knew what was going to happen and I learnt he managed
          to leave Singapore on time. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to hide and escape from here after the arrival of the Japanese. What a great hero he is! Initially, I also
           thought of leaving Singapore because of my association with the Chinese resistance and we all are well aware of the Japanese post-war activities in cleaning the anti-Japanese
            elements. But later I was convinced to stay back in Singapore. Since I am a businessman, I could use my connections to exchange vital information to oust the Japanese from
             Singapore. I know the risks connected to this role, but I am willing to do this for my country. I have to be very vigilant in my activities and recruit trustworthy informants.
